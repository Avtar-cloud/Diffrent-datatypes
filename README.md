💻 Data Types

🎯 Aim

To learn about various data types in programming, particularly in C++.

📚 Theory

Primitive data types are the most basic data types provided by a programming language. They are typically built-in and used to store simple values.

🔹 1. Integer (int)

Represents whole numbers without a fractional part.
Example: int marks = 25;

🔹 2. Float (float)

Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
Example: float x = 3.2f;

🔹 3. Double (double)

Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.
Example: double a = 9.97585858;

🔹 4. Character (char)

Represents a single character.
Example: char initial = 'A';

🔹 5. Boolean (bool)

Represents logical values: true or false.
Example: bool isStudent = true;

🔹 6. String (string)

Represents a sequence of characters.
Example: string name = "Aditya";

🛠️ In C++, string is part of the Standard Library and requires #include <string> and usage of std::string.

🧠 Conclusion

Understanding data types is fundamental to writing reliable and efficient programs. Each type whether integer, float, character, or string serves a distinct role in representing and manipulating information. By mastering these building blocks, you unlock the foundation of structured logic and expressive coding in C++.🧱💻
